# Experiment 4a
## AIM: To perfrom inserting an element into a Min-Max heap


## PROCEDURE 
### Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in increasing order: 
1. Build a max heap from the input data. 
2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of the tree. 
3. Repeat step 2 while size of heap is greater than 1.
### Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in decreaing order: 
1. Build a min heap from the input data.
2. At this point, the smallest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of tree.
3. Repeat above steps while size of heap is greater than 1.
