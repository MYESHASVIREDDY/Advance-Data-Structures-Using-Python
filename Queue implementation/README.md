## AIM: To implement all the operation in queue
## PROCEDURE: We can perform the following operations in the Queue.
o	Enqueue - The enqueue is an operation where we add items to the queue. If the queue is full, it is a condition of the Queue The time complexity of enqueue is O(1).
o	Dequeue - The dequeue is an operation where we remove an element from the queue. An element is removed in the same order as it is inserted. If the queue is empty, it is a condition of the Queue Underflow. The time complexity of dequeue is O(1).
o	Front - An element is inserted in the front end. The time complexity of front is O(1).
o	Rear - An element is removed from the rear end.. The time complexity of the rear is O(1).
