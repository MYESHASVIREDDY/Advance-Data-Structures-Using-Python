# EXPERIMENT 2C
## Aim of the experiment: To execute a program that uses functions to perform quick sort
### PROCEDURE:

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
